Egm :: very sensitive to cable movements --> stabilize movement
* muscles are very small so may need to find smaller sized electrodes + nicer way to stick it on the skin as the tape immobilizes some parts around the muscle being measured, and this most probably leads to inteference from neighbouring muscles


mmg :: 
potential to detect weaker contractions than emg however seems likes take more space up and measuring smallish muscles 

used for measuring fatigue of muscles in torque production -->should that be a problem, not that much as facial muscles are usually quite the same i suppose 


do fft adn remove noise signals on the data .. 
sources of noise:
* ambient noise: computers, source platform.. power lines -- 50_60khz : frequency of th epower supply 
* transducer noise : generated by the electrode  -- voltage potential caused by differences in the impedance between the skin and the electrode sensor and from ociadative and reductive chemical reactions taking place in the contact region between the electrode and the conductive gel -- dc
* transducer noise (ac) :voltage potential generated by factors such as fluctuations in impedance between the conductive transducer on the skin ... use AG-AGcl electrodes --> reduces impedance effect


be fat => spatial filtering and low pass filtering .. this does something read through this part again 
skin preparation takes the intial impedance from the skin away .. tis good to take some noise away
