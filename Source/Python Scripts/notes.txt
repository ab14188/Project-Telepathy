30/06/2016: * added a new feature_rate obtained much better
			* implemented faster way to obtain montage pdfs of the confusion matrices 
	//deleting some words such as 'no' also makes a better classification  

To-do list: * Algorithm that runs through all the different feature combinations such as to determin which combination is the best
			* try other classifiers
			* get more training data
			* combine all different training data and run a cross validation on it 


test4 = mouthed of test3 

the warning obtained from lda are in part due to the fact that lda does its own scaling
